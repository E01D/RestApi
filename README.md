# Rest Api

This project is a how-to project on how to create a rest api using the Evobolics Packages

Two tutorials will ulimately be offered.  The first will be one targetting .NET Framework 4.6. and then a .NET Core tutorial will be created.  Most of the contents of the two tutorials will be the same, but there are differences between the two, as the APIs being targetted differ.  

Tutorials:
* [Creating a .NET Framework 4.6 Rest Api](https://github.com/E01D/RestApi/wiki/Creating-a-.NET-Framework-4.6-Rest-Api)
* [Creating a .NET Core Rest Api](https://github.com/E01D/RestApi/wiki/Creating-a-.NET-Core-Rest-Api)
